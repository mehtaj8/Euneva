\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}

\subsection{Look and Feel}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-LFA1\\}

Type: Manual\\
Initial State: The web app has been loaded\\
Input: N/A\\
Output: N/A\\
How test will be performed: A visual test will be performed to confirm that the product looks similar to Apple’s Reminders Application\\

\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}

The existing implementation of the to-do list was built fine with modules exhibiting low coupling and high cohesion. The existing modules each had their own individual function and were not strongly related to one another. Each of the components of the user interface was clearly modularized, as such we did not have to modify any of the user interface components. We decided to introduce the ability to connect to Avenue to Learn and developed our own modules for this feature. To connect this feature to the application itself, we added two text fields and a button to the user interface allowing the user to enter their login credentials. Additionally, a task in the existing implementation did not have a date associated with it. We decided to add a date field as we felt a to-do list should keep track of the due date of a task. 

\section{Unit Testing}

Our team made the decision to forego unit testing due to the increased resources required for little to no gain. Since our app primarily focuses on the user interface and user experience, we opted to create a suite of manual tests to validate the various aspects of our app.

\section{Automated Testing}

A couple of the tests defined in the test plan were to be automated; however, during testing it was deemed infeasible. Given the time constraints, the team decided that the additional time investment required to set up the automated tests was not worth it. Instead we decided to perform manual tests and visually confirm our app was displaying the correct output.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

The team decided against using code coverage due to the fact that all the tests being performed are all manual tests. Due to not having any automated test cases another way we confirm that the code coverage was met was through the examination of the manual tests and the traceability matrix between modules. This makes it clear that the important functionality has been tested and the team feels confident the software is reliable and consistent.
