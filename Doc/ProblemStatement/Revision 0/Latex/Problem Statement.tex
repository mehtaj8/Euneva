\subsection{What problem are you trying to solve?}

Students may be managing five, six or even seven courses in one semester in addition to any extracurricular commitments they may have. Each course has an array of quizzes and assignments that students can easily lose track of due to the lack of consolidated information. The way Avenue presents important information is more of a hindrance than a convenience and makes it harder for students to manage deadlines. This unnecessary stress can be detrimental to a student's academic performance and mental well-being.

\subsection{Why is this an important problem?}

A recent study showed that 63\% of college students experienced overwhelming anxiety and 39\% have suffered from depression.$^1$ Additionally, over 40\% of college students take on a part time job. Balancing work, school and mental health is challenging, especially for younger individuals like students. Alleviating some of the stress from academics helps students avoid mental health issues and live a healthy lifestyle.\\

\subsection{What is the context of the problem you are solving?}

Our rendition of the Avenue linked To-Do list is aimed directly towards students that attend McMaster University. Students spend an average of 7 hours on their phones throughout the day. This can be used as an advantage to create a software solution that will be a Mobile Application compatible with iOS or Android, making it accessible on the go. The application is geared towards “Educational and Organizational” type niches.
