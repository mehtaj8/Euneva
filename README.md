# 3XA3-Project-L02-Group9

For developers to contribute follow this
- npm i
- from the root directory, do ```cd .git/hooks```
- then do chmod +x prepare-commit-msg.sample
- then do ``` cd ../..```
- then perform commits via ```git commit```
- once you are done with your commit, a page will show up with whatever you inputted, you edit one last time there
- then to save your commit, do ```:wq```

- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THIS, YOU CAN STILL COMMIT REGURARILY VIA ```git commit -m ``` (insert your message after the '-m')
- Then just use ```cntrl+c``` to exit the commitizen flow and immediately commit your message without all this overhead
